        <h1>Happy 5th Monthsary, Darling! ðŸ’•</h1>
        <p>
            I just want to remind you of something important, especially since I couldn't on the day when you felt down about things like exam scores or what others expect of you. 
            The things you've heard, the things you've seen, and the things people want from youâ€”none of that defines who you are. You are you. Don't ever lose yourself in all that noise, baby. Destiny only holds value when you create it yourself, and like you said, every moment, whether good or bad, can be a stepping stone.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that "hang in there" can be hard to hear sometimes. But itâ€™s just one of those things in life we all go through, and thereâ€™s no need to worry too much. The only person you need to surpass is yourself.
        </p>
        <div class="cute-message">
            <p>
                "They say we should love ourselves before others can truly love us, but sometimes we need someone else to love and accept us first. Through their eyes, we start to see the value in ourselves."
                <br><i>â€”Yuki Sohma</i>

            Iâ€™ve believed this for a long time, and I still do right now. To me, you are an amazing person. Since the moment we met, Iâ€™ve only shown you a tiny part of myself, but I felt completely understood. 
            Baby, if it's me, you can trouble me. Tell me anything, because even if the world were to end tomorrow, I would still believe in you.
        </p>
        <p class="heart">ðŸ’—</p>
        <p>
            In this world, I fear you the most. And in this world, I want you more than anyone else. Every day, your kind words and your care make me realize how beautiful it is to be cherished. I've lived my life waiting to meet you. 
            I regret not finding you sooner, but we canâ€™t change the past. Instead, letâ€™s create a present and a future better than anything behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to live on because you were alive. Because I knew you were living somewhere under the same sky. I've always wished for your happiness. 
            That's what has supported me to this day. You're the one who made me this strong. I can do sorts of things because you believe in me. Because you give me the strength and the will to get them done. 
            Everything's always easier when you're there, and harder when you're not. You give me the power to believe in myself, love. Itâ€™s not just that I love you. I need you.
        </p>
        <p class="heart">ðŸ’—</p>
        <p>
            I could walk alone at night, speak in front of a crowd, or drive fast down busy streets, but something about you makes me gentle. Makes me shy, strong, and happy to be alive. 
            Maybe that's what it really comes down to. You complete me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I once talked to God and said, "I know I complain a lot, and I know we have some issues, but thank you for her. Thank you."
            Letâ€™s continue to stay with each other as if every moment could be our last. Let's make promises we know we canâ€™t keep, and even If tomorrow happens to be our downfall, letâ€™s make every single day count.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ever feel like you're falling, there are more people here for you than you realize.
        </p>
      <p>
          And if that does happenâ€¦ 
      </p>
      <p>
          How far will you fall? And where should I wait to catch you?
